# How to run
### 1. Install **i686-elf**

Linux
```
sh ./install_compiler.sh
```
Mac
```
brew install i686-elf-gcc
```

### 2. Build iso image
```
make
or
make build
```
### 3. Run iso image in QEMU
```
make run
```

   Compile → objs/*.o
        │
        ▼
   Link (linker.ld) → kernel.bin
        │
        ▼
   Create ISO (grub.cfg + kernel.bin) → kfs-1.iso

   Boot with GRUB → CPU executes kernel_main
```

## 1. Compile
Files involved: `src/*.c`, `src/boot.s` -> `objs/*.o`

1. Use a cross-compiler `i686-elf-gcc` to create object files (*.o)

### Cross-compiler ?
A cross-compiler is a compiler that runs on one platform (e.g., your PC) but generates machine code for a different target platform (e.g., the 32-bit x86 architecture).

### What does `boot.s` do?
- Declare constants for the multiboot header
- Define the multiboot header
- Allocate stack memory for the kernel
- Call the C kernel entry point

## 2. Link
Files involved: `linker.ld`, `objs/*.o` -> `kernel.bin`

1. All object files are linked together into a single executable kernel binary (`kernel.bin`).

2. During compilation, the compiler uses the linker script (linker.ld) to prepare **memory addresses** for each section (code, data, stack).

### Why is custom linker needed?

The kernel runs **without an operating system**, so the CPU needs exact memory addresses for code and data. 

And `linker.ld` specifies this memory layout.

## 3. Create ISO
Files involved: `grub.cfg`, `kernel.bin` -> `kfs-1.iso`

1. Copy the kernel binary and GRUB configuration (`grub.cfg`) into an ISO file system structure.

2. Use `xorriso` to generate a bootable ISO (`kfs-1.iso`).
  - GRUB can find and load the kernel from the ISO.

### ISO file system structure
GRUB requires specific structure to create iso file.
```
iso/
 └── boot/
      ├── kernel.bin
      └── grub/
           └── grub.cfg
```

## 4. Boot with [GRUB](https://wiki.osdev.org/GRUB#Using_GRUB_to_boot_your_OS)
Files involved: `grub.cfg`, `kfs-1.iso`

1. Boot the ISO using QEMU or real hardware.

2. GRUB starts and reads `grub.cfg`.

  - It finds the kernel path and name inside the ISO.

3. GRUB loads the kernel into memory.

4. The CPU jumps to the kernel entry point (kernel_main).

5. The kernel takes control, initializes the terminal, VGA, and other basic systems.

## 5. Why we cannot use standard C libray functions?

 this kernel uses the VGA text mode buffer as the output device.

 1. libc depends on our os and

 2. kernel is SERVICE PROVIDER not consumer.

	- kernel role: IMPLEMENT printf for userspace. 

	- USER role: CALL printf

 3. Kernel has only raw resauces

	- No syscalls implemented yet

	- Direct physical memory.

	- No any (?) interface for userside (malloc, printf, fopen, ...)

## 6. GDT (global descriptor table)

### What is GDT ?

GDT helps manage how memory is accessed and protected. 

It's key role is to define **memory segments** and their attributes: the base address, the size, and access privileges like executability and writability.

### Memory segments ?
A memory segment is a portion (a block) of memory that is treated as a separate logical unit.

- Code segment → stores the program instructions
- Data segment → stores variables
- Stack segment → stores function calls and local data
- Extra segment → additional data storage

Each segment has its own segment register.
- CS (Code Segment) → program instructions
- DS (Data Segment) → program data
- SS (Stack Segment) → stack memory
- ES (Extra Segment) → extra data
